[![Build](https://github.com/pirafrank/zed_unofficial_win_builds/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pirafrank/zed_unofficial_win_builds/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains unofficial builds of the Zed editor for Windows.

## What is Zed?

<https://zed.dev>

## Why?

The official Zed editor is only available for macOS and Linux. This repository fills the gap until official builds for Windows will be available.

## Install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/pirafrank/zed_unofficial_win_builds/releases/latest) and put it in a directory of your choice. A good place could be:

```txt
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Zed
```

> [!TIP]
> Create a shortcut to `zed.exe` and to place it here to add Zed to the Start Menu.
>
> ```txt
> %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Zed
> ```

## Configuration

Zed writes config here:

```txt
%APPDATA%\Zed
```
